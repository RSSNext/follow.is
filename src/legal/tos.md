### 6.1 User Content

Folo enables you to import, subscribe to, and read content via RSS feeds. You retain ownership of any content you post, upload, or submit. By sharing content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to host, display, modify, and distribute your content as necessary to operate, improve, and provide the Service.

All trademarks, logos, and service marks are the property of Natural Selection Limited or their respective owners. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

### 6.3 AI Features and Usage

Folo incorporates AI-powered features for content translation, summarization, and recommendations. We strive to ensure these features provide useful outputs, but we do not guarantee their accuracy, completeness, or reliability. You should independently verify AI-generated content, especially for critical decisions.

For significant changes (e.g., affecting user rights, fees, or data use), we will notify you at least 14 days in advance via email, in-app notification, or our website (https://folo.is). If you disagree with the changes, you may terminate your account before they take effect by contacting us or using account settings. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
